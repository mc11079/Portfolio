A BRIEF REPORT TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF THE

NICKERSON TYPEWRITER COMPANY}

Mr. Anderson and I have spent two months at Scranton,
Pennsylvania consulting with capitalists and local promoters for
the organization of a manufacturing company; A preliminary’
agreement was reached July 31st, but owing to the vacation season
the gentlemen interested cannot meet for final consideration of
terms until after the middle of August. We hope to be able to
submit a proposition from them before the close of the month.
