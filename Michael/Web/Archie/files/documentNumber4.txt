As :ucy Bennett explains in "Retearching Online Eandom," whicn .as first
nubliehed in the Cinema Journal, "....ocial media can be employed aw a
tool by modern celebrities to mobilise their fan bases" (131). In mg

research of the #BetterCallSaul hashtag, l have seen what bennett

f).

e cribes many times. The celebrities involved with the new series often
tweet out hints and clues to the Show, and there is alot of interaction
between fans and the cast and crew. As I noted earlier in a po t, Rhea
Seehorn, an actress on the show, even eld a Twitter oaA. Was this nice

of her to do? Yes, it was. But were there ulterior motives; Absolutely.

v-s

2y tweeting about the show, Ms. Seehorn was able to drive more traffic to
the series, thus publicizing it more. It is basiccaly a call to action
as she is "mobilizing" the fan base.

Bennett later goes on to elaboate how "objects of fandom communicate with
their fans on Twitter, a medium that potentially allout a direct connect
ion between both parties" (132). Here, we see how much Twitter a no coci
al networks are changing TV. It has become much more social. Instead of

watching “V and doing just that, now there ismore interaction.

As dOCtors Natalia Quintas-Froufe and Ana Gonzalez-Neira note in their
article "Active A udiences: Social Audience Participation in TV,»
originaally published in the Comunitar Journal, " Social TV has forcibly
arrived in the media ecosystem as a result of the evolution opposed by
the combination of social networks, second screenS, and telev isionfl
(84}. We did not see this coming and me did not predict this. Some seeii

as evolution and the natural order of things. (Professor End researcher

Nancy Baym would describe the increasing "need" vs ieel to participate

in these social audiences as #technological determinismv.
Linking the "Activ E Audiences" article with Bennett's article,'uuintas-
Froufe and Gonzalez-Neira go on to highlight the point that "The
traditdonally static audience has evolved into a species of prosumer
that interacts with the TV programs guests and presenters" (84).
As Breaking Bad neared the end of its 5-

season ran we saw t
audience increase. The show was a to: ' he Boeial

idently, that fan base has

But the major question here: Why? why d these viewent shows about
bad people draw in such a large audience.
we can Perhaps find an answer in age firnhull's "3 ime as Entertainment:

c on, and why it is so ponular. First,
Turnbull explains how pack in th 37th century, people read about

because it was said that

drama. She says, "The possibility t1“
highwaymen not to mention public execu.:3
ekperienced as 'entertaining' clear‘" did not cross the moralists'
minds... Whatever the motivations o the audience, ‘ 's cleat that
representation of crime have Eeen, and continue to be, immensely
popular" (821),
Everybody has different tastes when it comes to television, and
storytelling in general. But what makes an antihero committing crimes
so appealing? Turnbull goes on to explain, "... crime drama has continue
to develop as a genre which can encompass stylistic variation and
innovation" {823). rarticularly in Ereaking Bad, and now better Call
Saul, we see all kinds of innovation and anions things on the dourney
of the antihero that make these shows unlike anything else.
Yes, they are dramas, but they are very different. aesthetically, they
can stand on their own, and the writing of Vince Gilligan, Peter Gould
and others is always compelling in its own right. Of the tweets that
comprise the #BetterCallSaal has tag, many of them foods on direct
quotes from the show, as viewers find them memorable, bad ass, funny,
or any combination of the three.
With all of this being said, one thing remains abundantly clear: TV
fandom will continue to grow through social media and other means, and
there is no telling what the future of technology will hold for the

future of fandom.
