it is in us all. a deep longing and inevitable desire
to feel as if we have meaning. it has been that way
since dust became flesh and breathe became life.
3°“ 899. we search with our starving hands. starv1ng
to the point where we no longer care what is agony
and what is utter joy. and try and grab at anything
that feels tangible. my god. we need things to be real.
no matter how much something hurts us. irtruly think
all along. we've only cared for what truly makes us
feel. the tiniest bit of something. to feel something
ihas always been better than feeling nothing. to know
the hearts in our chests. the lungs inside our rib
cages. and the poignant breaths theygive. have not
existed in vain. that on their journey. their brave
quest to find the thing they thought they wanted.
and though what they found was not what they expected.

it so happens that all along. it is exactly what
they needed.

it is so brave to just live. so brave. we hurt and yearn
and thirst and burn and yet still. every aching night.
we spill our necks onto out pillows with the hope that
when our eyes awake from the black and find the
morning light. they will be new. we have to believe it.
on the days when we feel fully drained of the thought
of carrying on. we have to keep going. for the sun
throws our shadows against the ground. and do we run?
no. we smile and then sigh because we realize we are
alive. that we are capable of love and hope and no
matter how much we suffer. or how many times we run

so the terrible things for truth. there is always a

3 that greets the moon. and in its passing
gfifgporg. "it's a brand new day."
