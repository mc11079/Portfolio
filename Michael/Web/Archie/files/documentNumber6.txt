Life has been moving pretty fast lately.
It seesas that I an having difficulty
keeping up. I an final starting to
feel better after e g sick for the

better part of the last month. I am
grateful for that.

Cn the typewriter front, I have a nice
Smith-Corona Silent Super that l have

been cleaning. However, Just when I

thought the nachine was unchanically sound

I noticed that the natal ruler that sits
against the platen: eels loose on the right
end. The type slugs mice a rather unpleasant
sound when striking the paper. It would seem
that they are barely hitting the edge of the
metal rule making an annoying tinny sound.

I an also in the process of reaming w
webeite. Pretty mach everything will change.
Since I already own sous web hosting, 1 plan
to me this site over there and save myself
sons money each month.

I hope everyone has a great Thanlmiving:

Brynn
